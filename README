This is another fork of Anobii2Goodreads meant to work with Italian
CSV exports.

This script converts a standard CSV export from the Anobii website to
a format you should be able to import into Goodreads.

I have not written this script myself but just adapted it a bit so it
works again. I've put it on Github since i think it might prove useful
to more people than just me.

You'll find the original by Giacomo Lacava here:
